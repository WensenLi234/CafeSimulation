CafeSimulation class:
   - Imports:
       - The Hashtable class for key-value pairs in arrays.
   - Variables:
       - private int difficulty, which will be used to determine how hard the game will be.
       - private int days set to 0 by default, which will implement each time the store opens.
       - private double bank, which will be how much money your cafe has.
       - private double rent, which will be how much money is deducted from your bank each time you
       open the store.
       - private final String[] availablePositions set to an array of strings representing a position a worker can take.
       - private final String[] availableProducts set to an array of strings representing the names of products that
       are available in the cafe simulation.
       - private final Double[] availablePrices set to an array of numbers representing the price of its corresponding
       index in availableProducts.
       - private Hashtable workers that uses a Hashtable to generate a dictionary with the occupation of a worker and
       how many are working in that occupation.
       - private Hashtable products that uses a Hashtable to generate a dictionary of the amount of each product the cafe
       will have.
       - private Hashtable prices that uses a Hashtable to generate a dictionary with the name of a product as a key and
       the price of the product as its value.
       - private Hashtable stockPrices that uses a Hashtable to generate a dictionary with the name of each product
       available in the game as the key and the corresponding price as the value.
   - Methods:
       - A CafeSimulation constructor that takes in a parameter 'difficulty', which sets the instance's 'difficulty' to
       the argument of 'difficulty', bank to 100 / (1 + difficulty / 10.0), rent to 10 * (1 + difficulty / 10.0), adds
       - A int getAmount method that will take in a String 'product' and look for the key named 'product' in products, then return
       its value. If there is no key named 'product', it will instead print "Not a valid product".
       - A void addProduct method that will take in a String 'product' and int 'amount' to look for the key in products
       named the literal of 'product' and add 'amount' to its value. If there is no key named 'product', it will create a key
       named 'product' and set its value to 'amount', and prompt the player to set a price using the changePrice method.
       - A void setPrice method that will take in a String 'product' and double 'amount' to set the value of
       key 'product' in products to 'amount'. If there is no key named 'product', it will instead print "Not a valid
       product". If 'amount' is less than 0, it will instead print "Not a valid price".
       - A void addWorker method that will take in a String 'occupation' and an int 'amount' to add 'amount' to the value
       of key 'occupation' in workers.
       - A double getBank method that will return the value of bank.
       - A double getRent method that will return the value of rent.
       - A double get
       - A Hashtable getProducts method that returns 'products'.
       - A Hashtable getPrices method that returns 'prices'.
       - A Hashtable getWorkers method that returns 'workers'.
       - A Hashtable getStockPrices that takes in a String 'product' and searches for it in 'stockPrices', and returns
       the value of the key 'product'. If there is no key named 'product', it will instead print "Not a valid product".
CafeSimulationRunner class:
   - Imports:
       - The Scanner class for user input.
   - Algorithm:
       - Prompt the user for a difficulty from 1 to 3
       - Construct a new instance of CafeSimulation called 'cafeSimulation' with the user input as the argument to the 'difficulty' parameter.
       - Loop through the following until the output of the getBank method in cafeSimulation is below or equal to 0:
            - Display the output of the getProducts method, and getBank method, and getWorker method,
            then Loop through the following until the Open store option
                - Prompt the player to input an integer corresponding to the following actions:
                    - (1) Buy products
                    - (2) Open store
                    - (3) Manage workers
                    - (4) Change prices
                - If the user input is 1, then prompt the player to name a product in stock, and the quantity of the product,
                then call the addProduct method and deduct the quantity.
                - If the user input is 2, then call the openStore method.
                - If the user input is 3, then prompt the player to input an integer corresponding to the following actions:
                    - (1) Hire a worker
                    - (2) Fire a worker
                - Prompt the player to input the name of the occupation, and declare a String 'inputJob' and set it to
                the user input, then prompt the player to input the amount to hire/fire. If
                - If the user input is 4, then prompt the player to name a product, and declare a String 'inputProduct'
                and set it to the user input, then prompt the player to set a price, and call the setPrice method with
                'inputProduct' and the user input as the arguments for their respective parameters, from left to right.
       - Once the loop ends, the game will
